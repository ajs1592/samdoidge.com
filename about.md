<!--a href="mailto:sam@samdoidge.com" class="available">available âœ…</a-->

I'm a web developer based in the UK, currently working for a cryptocurrency startup. I've recently been contracting for a <a href="https://www.castletrust.co.uk/">finance company</a>, and developing a <a href="https://coininterest.co">Bitcoin investment website</a>. In my free time I like to think of ideas and execute them. I continually look to learn and I try not to impose limits on myself.

Outside of the internet some of my interests include: playing football, rowing (now only in the gym), design and reading.
